Hmm after posting yesterday's diary, and went on my bed I was chilling for like 2 hours. Then, I randomly felt like complete shit for 0 reason. Hmm also understood Spotify messages --> not for me. kayyyy so I felt like shit for like 12-2:30, when I just forced myself asleep. lol. Talked to mars bout why i was feeling shit and just blamed my previous diary entry for it, cuz that was the only possible thing I did today that made me feel shit or ik what it is and didnt tell her and don;t want to say it ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”. LOL prbly it is that one. The reluctance to admit to myself why I felt like shit ðŸ˜Š. 

Woke up at 9:30, kinda late

Kay well working on fixing my spotify today for some time in the morning.

Finished and turned in Letter of Recc for krunky

Finished Japanese Summer HW #2 ~ listening and writing waste. Opened #3 and #4, and #3 was fucking 31 pages of kanji and #4 is prbly chill. Need to start getting it done this week. Will start working on it tmrw after pool 

Now writing my diary and am hyped to go to gym again tmrw at 9 ðŸ˜Š, cuz i havent gone in like a week+. After gym is pool at saahil's which will be interesting. Hopefully nothing too waste. Kay also starting to track my daily weight. Literally just finished eating and I haven't worked out in a week, so I am 100% bloated af, but wtvr 156.4.
