Hmm after posting yesterday's diary, and went on my bed I was chilling for like 2 hours. Then, I randomly felt like complete shit for 0 reason. Hmm also understood Spotify messages --> not for me. kayyyy so I felt like shit for like 12-2:30, when I just forced myself asleep. lol. Talked to mars bout why i was feeling shit and just blamed my previous diary entry for it, cuz that was the only possible thing I did today that made me feel shit or ik what it is and didnt tell her and don't want to say it ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”. LOL prbly it is that one. The reluctance to admit to myself why I felt like shit ðŸ˜Š. 

Woke up at 9:30, kinda late

Kay well working on fixing my spotify today for some time in the morning.

Finished and turned in Letter of Recc for krunky

Finished Japanese Summer HW #2 ~ listening and writing waste. Opened #3 and #4, and #3 was fucking 31 pages of kanji and #4 is prbly chill. Need to start getting it done this week. Will start working on it tmrw after pool 

Now writing my diary and am hyped to go to gym again tmrw at 9 ðŸ˜Š, cuz i havent gone in like a week+. After gym is pool at saahil's which will be interesting. Hopefully nothing too waste. Kay also starting to track my daily weight. Literally just finished eating and I haven't worked out in a week, so I am 100% bloated af, but wtvr 156.4.

Always choosing: goal forced upon you --> terrifying and painful, however if you choose it, it is glorious and important milestone when you achieve it. feedback dopamine motivation after achievement. miserableness, cuz chances are it's bc u feel like the problem/situation is out of ur control. Hmm xDDDDDDDDD. Perfect description. Choosing problems = empowered. Problems thrown at you = victimized and miserable. bro so true lol

Your choice: William James life story - very interesting. Your responsibility to interpret the meaning of the even and choose a response.

To not give a fuck about anything is still to give a fuck about something. 

What do we choose to give a fuck about?What values choosing to base actions on? What metrics choosing to measure one's life? good choices, good values, good metrics?

"With great responsibility comes great power" - accepting responsibility in our life, the more power we can exercise over our life.

Dating relation: Don't go on a date with a girl, with the idea you won't be successfull because of insecurities such as women think im too short, etc... Choce of value was disempowering. Better, more attractive value: "I want to date women who like me for who I am"

**I am always Responsible for my own demise. It is my own responsibility to make myself happy again**
1. exercise âœ…
2. Spend time with friends âœ…
3. meeting new people âœ…
4. big project 

**There will always be resentment, but taking responsibility for my own emotion. Rather then getting her to fix something she broke, work on something you broke yourself. That is what you have control over**
